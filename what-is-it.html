  <div class="about">
    Half of Londonâ€™s clubs have been forced to close in the last decade, and more has been sacrificed due to the last two years of the virus.
    <br><br>
    Rising rents mean clubs are being squeezed, left putting profit over community.
    <br><br>
    We donâ€™t want to be consumers. We want to participate in a collective practice of movement and exploration, community and freedom. We want to (re)build spaces for collective joy.
    <br><br>
  <tag style="color:white">* âœ§ : âœ§â€™âœ§ : âœ§â€™âœ§ : âœ§â€™âœ§ : âœ§ *</tag>
    <br><br>
    Why is this happening and how do we rebuild these spaces?
    <br><br>
    Reflections Of is a series of workshops to co-create new experiences.
    <br><br>
    Bring your ideas, your memories, dreams and desires for what clubbing should be. With you, we want to create a co-created clubbing experience.
    <br><br>
  <tag style="color:white">* âœ§ : âœ§â€™âœ§ : âœ§â€™âœ§ : âœ§â€™âœ§ : âœ§ *</tag>
    <br><br>
    The workshops will focus on three themes: <br> Noise / Space / Ritual
    <br><br>
    Each workshop is a pilot of our wider ambitions â€“ an experimental matrix exploring what is possible.
    <br><br>
    We will eat together, adapt spaces, share ideas and make noise.
    New rituals for different times.
